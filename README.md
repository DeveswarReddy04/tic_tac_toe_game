# tic_tac_toe_game
This is a console-based implementation of the classic Tic-Tac-Toe game, developed in C. The program allows two players to take turns playing on a 3x3 grid and determines the winner or a draw based on the standard rules of the game. It's a beginner-friendly project that demonstrates the use of control structures, arrays, and basic game logic in C.
